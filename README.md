# deep_nowcaster

## Objective 

The objective of this project is to develop a nowcasting system (weather prediction system) by integrating 
data from various different sources. This git hub repo consists of all the code required to build the data pipline for
my Masters Thesis titled "Exploration Into Machine Learning techniques for precipitation nowcasting" advised by
David L. Pepyne. This is currently a work in progress and thus this readme document will only detail a very high level 
description of whats in here. Please refer to my proposal document for more information about the project.
